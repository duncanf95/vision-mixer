## About 
This was a person project to try and recreate a product called the stream deck by elgato. The stream deck links up with popular livestream broadcasting and recording software such as OBS. It can then send commands to these softwares that allow the user more intutive control.

The project worked by having a raspberry pi and touch screen connected across a network to the broadcast computer. There would be client and server software. The client (raspberry pi) would send codes to the server (broadcast pc) and the broadcast pc would execute commands based on these codes.
